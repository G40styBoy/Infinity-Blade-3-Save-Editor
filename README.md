# Save Editor Usage

## Written Guide
    1. Once the program is downloaded and the .ZIP has been extracted, keep the "IB3 Save Editor" File.
    2. Place your save file named "UnencryptedSave0.bin" inside of the "SAVE" file.
    3. As long as the Save Editor recognizes the save file, you're good to go. Your changes will be
    flushed to the save file automatically, so once you're done you can just copy the new file and 
    do as you wish.

# Exporting / Importing Saves
## Prerequisite Setup
1. You will first need the [IB3 Unofficial Patch](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1svHjQxE4u_yDy1RzDh0i1Kvic2iWIudi?usp=sharing).
2. If you're not jailbroken, you need to have file sharing enabled when you Sideload the IPA. File Sharing can be found and enabled in the Sideloadly Application under Advanced Options.

## Obtaining & Exporting your Unencrypted Save File
    1. In game, go to Inventory ➜ Options .
    2. There will be an option to "Export Save ➜".
    3. Once the button has been pressed, Infinity Blade 3 will then export the Unencrypted Save File into your save file directory.
    If you're jailbroken you can access that via Filza. However if not, we need to use the IOS "Files" app to access it.
        For Non-Jailbroken devices. In "Files" at the bottom, go to " Browse ➜ On My iPhone ➜ Infinity Blade 3 "
    4. You will now see a file called "UnencryptedSave0.bin", this is your Unencrypted Save File.

## Importing your Unencrypted Save File
        Prerequisite Info
        - Currently, it is REQUIRED that the file name when importing is "UnencryptedSave0.bin".
        - When you import a save make sure you want to replace the one you're currently on. 
        The game will rewrite the current save you're on.

        1. Place the "UnencryptedSave0.bin" file into IB3's Save folder, or Browse ➜ On My iPhone ➜ Infinity Blade 3 .
        2. In game, go to Inventory ➜ Options , then press "import Save Slot 0". Your save will now be loaded.
